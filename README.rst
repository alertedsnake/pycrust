Pycrust
=======

This package is a collection of CherryPy tools and add-ons.

Requirements
============

There are no actual "requirements" though if you try to use 
functionality without the supporting modules, you'll get 
exceptions.  For example, you can't use the SQLAlchemy tool 
(pycrust.satool) unless you've got SQLAlchemy installed, though
it's not an actual "requirement" for building this package.


Submodules
==========

See also the following submodules:

    ``pycrust.auth``
    ``pycrust.saplugin``
    ``pycrust.satool``
    ``pycrust.tools``


Credit
======

Some of the code herein was based-on or taken from blog or wiki
postings on the web.  Credit has been given where possible, but if
I've missed something, please let me know.  This package isn't 
intended to step on the toes of others, but rather to collect a 
bunch of tools that I use into one place.
